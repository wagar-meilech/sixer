# Sixer

Sixer is a transformative, social connection platform that leverages the power of machine learning and local business involvement to create events and match participants based on their interests and responses to surveys. Our application uses an innovative auction system that lets local businesses sponsor these events, promoting community involvement while enhancing the quality of the events.
